# Project: Simulation of Downlink Behaviour of a 3-sectored Basestation

## Author: Pranav H. Deo (Duhh!)


#### Programming language: Python
#### Package used: Numpy


#### Pre-requisite: Knowledge of Cellular concepts (GSM)
#### Cellular Concepts: Propogation Loss, Fading, Shadowing, Sectoring, GOS, User call probability, Dropped calls, Hand-offs, Fade-margin and the list does not end.


#### Code and Outputs:
#### I know you want the code! Just remember, copying is easy...creating something on your own isn't... Anyways here is the information-
#### * You will find code in the file named Cellular_Simulation.py (ofcourse)
#### * When you run the code you will get some output textfiles which contain Active users, Call Records, Sector information at every second instance.
#### * The code is developed to handle any no. of simulation hours and can be modified according to your needs...
#### * Finally, YOU'RE WELCOME.... NOW DO YOUR THING!!!
